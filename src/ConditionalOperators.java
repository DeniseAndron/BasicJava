//    * For example, what if we want to run a code block only if multiple conditions are true. We could use the AND operator: &&.
//    * Or, we want to run a code block if at least one of two conditions are true. We could use the OR operator: ||.
//    * Finally, we can produce the opposite value, where true becomes false and false becomes true, with the NOT operator: !.*/

//    //&& AND operator
//
////The OR operator, ||, is used between two boolean values and evaluates to a single boolean value.
//// If either of the two values is true, then the resulting value is true, otherwise the resulting value is false.
//
//    //Logical NOT: !
//    //The unary operator NOT, !, works on a single value. This operator evaluates to the opposite boolean to which itâ€™s applied:

//        boolean hasPrerequisite = false;
//
//        if (!hasPrerequisite) {
//            System.out.println("Must complete prerequisite course!");
//            //the order of evaluation when it comes to conditional operators is as follows:
//            //Conditions placed in parentheses - ()
//            //NOT - !
//            //AND - &&
